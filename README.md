# 100-DaysOfYara
My internship project
* Setup azure machine or malware lab
* Go through 100 days of yara
* Fetch 3 months of malware bazaar data parsed by family
* write my own yara rules based on IoCs of such families
* link it to vt-intelligence

<b>If the True Positives are above 70-80%, I'll be writing yara rules for a malware generalizing algorithm</b>
